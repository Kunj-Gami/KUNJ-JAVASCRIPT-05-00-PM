# Task: Introduction to JavaScript - ES5 vs ES6, Output Methods, and Variables

## Objective:
In this task, you will apply the key concepts of **JavaScript ES5 and ES6**, **output methods**, and **variable declarations** to create simple programs and demonstrate your understanding of these topics. You will work with **variables**, **data types**, and learn to display output using different methods like `console.log()`, `document.write()`, `alert()`, and `innerHTML`.

# Difference Between `var`, `let`, and `const` in ES5 and ES6

| **Feature**        | **`var` (ES5)**                        | **`let` (ES6)**                     | **`const` (ES6)**                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Declaration**     | `var x = 10;`                         | `let x = 10;`                       | `const x = 10;`                    |
| **Scope**           | Function scope                        | Block scope                         | Block scope                        |
| **Re-declaration**  | Allowed within the same scope          | Not allowed within the same scope   | Not allowed                        |
| **Re-assignment**   | Allowed                               | Allowed                             | Not allowed                        |
| **Hoisting**        | Variables are hoisted but initialized as `undefined`. | Variables are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone). | Variables are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone). |
| **Mutability**      | Mutable                               | Mutable                             | Immutable                          |
| **Use Case**        | Suitable for globally scoped variables or older code. | Best for variables that change within a block or loop. | Best for constants or values that do not change. |

## Instructions:

1. **ES5 vs ES6**:
   - Write two simple programs: 
     1. One using **ES5 syntax** to declare variables and log the output.
     2. Another using **ES6 syntax** (with `let`, `const`, and arrow functions) to achieve the same results.
   - Compare both approaches and highlight the differences in the code.

2. **Output Methods**:
   - Use the following output methods to display information in different ways:
     - **`console.log()`**: Log output to the browser's console.
     - **`document.write()`**: Write output directly into the webpage's HTML.
     - **`alert()`**: Show an alert message with the output.
     - **`innerHTML`**: Change the content of an HTML element dynamically with JavaScript.
   - Create simple code snippets for each method that outputs a message or result.
  
3. **Variables, Data Types, and Initialization**:
   - Declare variables of different data types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`).
   - Initialize these variables and display their values using the output methods discussed.
   - Show the difference between **var**, **let**, and **const**:
     - **`var`**: Used in ES5 (function-scoped).
     - **`let`**: Introduced in ES6 (block-scoped).
     - **`const`**: Used to declare constants (also block-scoped).

4. **Task Example**:
   - Write a program that declares and initializes variables for a student's name (string), age (number), and passed (boolean), and display the information using the different output methods.

## Deliverables:
- Submit your **JavaScript code** (including both ES5 and ES6 versions) via **GitHub**.
- Include **code comments** explaining the differences between ES5 and ES6, as well as the purpose of each output method and variable declaration.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Submit the task before **1st January 2025, 4:59 PM**.
- Push the source code to **GitHub** and provide a link to the live output hosted on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the difference between **ES5** and **ES6** features.
- Gain proficiency in **declaring and initializing variables** in JavaScript.
- Learn how to display output using multiple methods in JavaScript.
